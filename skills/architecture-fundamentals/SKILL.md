description: Shape a system or a change so it stays simple to understand, change and operate. Use when choosing a stack, drawing module boundaries, placing new code, or judging whether a change fits the structure it lands in.

Good architecture is the cheapest structure that makes the next change easy. Judge every structural choice by what it costs the next person who has to read or change it.

**Start from what exists**
- Read the project brain (brain/project.md, brain/decisions/) and the neighbouring code before you propose anything. Follow the existing structure and naming unless you can name the concrete problem that breaking it solves.
- A decision record that is already accepted is a constraint. If the work needs to break one, say so and record a new decision; do not quietly work around it.

**Boundaries**
- Give each module one reason to exist and a small interface that hides how it works. A module is deep when a lot of behaviour sits behind few entry points.
- Dependencies point one way: domain logic knows nothing about delivery (HTTP, CLI, UI) or storage; the edges depend on the core, never the reverse.
- Keep input and output at the edges. Parse and validate once at the boundary, then pass typed, trusted data inward. Pure functions in the middle are the ones you can test without a harness.
- One source of truth for every fact: a constant, a schema, a config value. A second copy is a future bug.

**Size the design to the problem**
- Choose the smallest stack and the fewest moving parts that ship the stated scope. Name what version one deliberately leaves out.
- Do not build for a requirement nobody has stated. No plugin system for one plugin, no abstraction with one implementation, no config flag for a value that never changes.
- Prefer boring, well documented technology already used in the project over a new dependency. Every new dependency needs a reason that a standard library or existing module cannot meet.

**State, failure and operation**
- Say where every piece of state lives, who owns it and how long it lives. Shared mutable state is the first place to look for a defect.
- Fail closed and loudly: an unknown input, a missing file or a malformed record is an error with a named reason, never a silent default.
- Make behaviour deterministic where it can be. Anything that can be decided by plain code should not be left to a model or to timing.
- Configuration comes from the environment or a config file, secrets never from the tree.

**Record the decision**
- When you make a choice that a reasonable engineer could have made differently, write down the context, the decision and the consequence in a few lines, where the project keeps decisions.
- State the trade off honestly: what this choice makes harder.

**Before you hand off, check**
- Can you describe each new module in one sentence without the word "and"?
- Does any new code reach across a boundary it should not?
- Is there a simpler structure that satisfies the same spec scenarios? If yes, use it.
