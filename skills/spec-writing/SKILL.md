description: Write a specification that a different person can build and test from without asking questions. Use when turning a work order or an idea into requirements and scenarios.
---

The spec is the contract the whole line works from. A vague spec produces a vague build that still passes review, because reviewers judge against the spec. Every quality problem you leave open here is paid for downstream.

**Before writing**
- Read the existing specs and the project brain. Reuse the project's terms; do not invent a second name for a thing that already has one.
- Look for conflicts with specs that are already accepted. If this order contradicts one, name both clauses and resolve it in the spec instead of leaving it for the builder to discover.
- If the work order is missing something you need to state a requirement, say exactly what is missing. Do not fill the gap with a guess dressed as a requirement.

**Requirements**
- One requirement states one obligation. Give each a stable id (R1, R2) so tests and reviews can cite it.
- Write observable behaviour, not implementation: what the system does for which input, not which class does it. Constrain the implementation only where the order requires it.
- Replace every soft word with a number or a named condition. "Fast", "good looking", "robust", "user friendly", "responsive" are not requirements until they say what is measured: "renders with no horizontal scroll at 360 px", "p95 under 200 ms", "body text contrast at least 4.5:1".
- Use a plain trigger form where it helps: "When <trigger>, the system shall <response>." "While <state>, ...". "If <unwanted condition>, then ...".

**Scenarios**
- Every requirement has at least one scenario, and every scenario names the requirement it proves. A requirement with no scenario will not be tested.
- Write each scenario as a concrete example: given this state, when this happens, then this observable result. Use real values, not placeholders.
- Cover the unhappy paths on purpose: empty input, the boundary value, the malformed record, the missing dependency, the second call. Most defects live there.
- A scenario must be checkable by a test or by named evidence. If you cannot say how it would be checked, rewrite it.

**Quality bars belong in the spec**
- For anything a person will see or use, state the quality bar as acceptance criteria: the reference to match, the viewport range, the states that must exist, the performance or accessibility floor. If it is not written here, no reviewer can hold the build to it.
- Name the evidence the run must produce (captures, measurements, a traversal proof) so the builder knows to produce it.

**Scope**
- State what is out of scope and which files or surfaces must not change. Enumerate the full write set when protected paths are involved, including test adaptations.
- Keep the spec as short as the contract allows. Rationale goes in one Purpose paragraph, not in every requirement.

**Before you hand off, check**
- Could two builders read this and ship materially different things? Then it is not specific enough.
- Does every R have an S, and every S a named R?
- Is every number in the spec one you verified or one the owner stated?
