# Task packet: reviewer-design

## Station prompt

# Reviewer Design

## Role
Judge interface output against the project's own design system: its design tokens, component and layout rules, motion rules, and quality bars.

## Inputs
- design system (tokens, rules, quality bars from design/DESIGN.md and design/tokens.json)
- interface output (HTML, React components, CSS, user-facing pages, or other interface artifacts)

## Outputs
- review (JSON format with verdict and findings)

## Rules
- Work only from the inputs listed above and the work order in the packet.
- If the project has no design system (no design/DESIGN.md), your verdict MUST be `changes_requested` with a finding stating that no design system exists for the project.
- If the project has a design system, review the interface output against:
  - Design tokens: Are the correct colors, typography, spacing values being used?
  - Component and layout rules: Do components follow the documented patterns?
  - Motion rules: Does any animation or transition follow the motion guidelines?
  - Quality bars: Does the interface meet the stated quality bars for visual hierarchy, scale contrast, spacing rhythm, and responsive behavior?
- Focus on the design system the project has defined. Do not impose external design opinions or preferences that are not documented in the project's design system.
- A design token marked as "TODO" or placeholder means the project hasn't defined that value yet. Flag missing values as findings only if the interface output actually uses undefined tokens.
- Findings should be specific and actionable: cite which quality bar was violated, which token was used incorrectly, or which rule was not followed.
- Your verdict must be one of: `pass`, `fail`, or `changes_requested`.
- Produce the output as a JSON object, not as chat text.

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "station": "reviewer-design",
  "verdict": "pass | fail | changes_requested",
  "findings": [
    "Specific finding with reference to design system rule or quality bar",
    "Another finding if applicable"
  ]
}

The station field must equal "reviewer-design", the verdict must be one of pass, fail, or changes_requested, and findings must be a list of strings.

## Examples

Example 1: No design system exists
- verdict: changes_requested
- finding: "No design system exists for this project. The project must define design/DESIGN.md and design/tokens.json before interface output can be reviewed against design standards."

Example 2: Interface violates quality bar
- verdict: changes_requested
- findings:
  * "Quality bar violation: Scale Contrast - The button text has only 2.8:1 contrast ratio against its background, failing the minimum 4.5:1 requirement stated in the quality bars."
  * "Token usage: The page uses hardcoded color '#FF5733' instead of the defined primary color token."

Example 3: Interface meets design system
- verdict: pass
- findings: (empty list)

- title: Risk and surface routing of reviewer sets and station models
- source: github-issue
- description: Implement the spec in .openspec/specs/risk-routing/spec.md in the factory. It consumes the risk and surfaces the intake outcomes capability stamps on the work order; that capability lands before this one in the same program, so build against its model fields.

Build, per the spec scenarios:

S1: a deterministic routing step after intake and before the reviewer stage; low risk with no ui and no security surface selects the reduced reviewer set (reviewer-spec and reviewer-tests) at the cheaper configured reviewer model, with the rule named as the reason.

S2: a security surface at any risk level always keeps reviewer-security in the set at the strong configured reviewer model.

S3: a null risk rating defaults to the full panel at the policy models, with the routing record stating the default applied because the work was unrated. A ui surface keeps reviewer-design in the set whenever the pipeline has it. Medium risk is the full panel at policy models; high risk the same with no reduction recorded.

S4: the recorded model routing policy is a ceiling: routing may reduce, never exceed it, and a project routing configuration that assigns a model above the policy for a station kind fails at config load naming the violation.

S5: a routed out reviewer is recorded as routed out with its rule; the approver treats it as not expected, and its review count names the expected count after routing.

S6: the routing record lands in the run report as its own section (selected set, selected models, reason per decision) and the swimlane shows a one line summary.

Routing rules live in project configuration with a factory shipped default table. Routing never changes the checks gate or the scenario-to-test gates. Tests covering S1 to S6 in the factory suite style, docs updated, CHANGELOG Unreleased updated. Keep the whole suite green and every pipeline valid.

### Quality bars

for Product Pages

These bars apply to every product page or interface this project ships.

### Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Clear content hierarchy with size, weight, and spacing
- [ ] Important actions are visually prominent
- [ ] Related elements are grouped

### Scale Contrast
- [ ] Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- [ ] Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (18pt+)
- [ ] Interactive elements have sufficient contrast

### Spacing Rhythm
- [ ] Consistent spacing scale used throughout
- [ ] Whitespace creates clear content boundaries
- [ ] Spacing adapts appropriately to different screen sizes

### Responsive Behavior
- [ ] Layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
- [ ] Text is readable without zooming on any device
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on standard viewports


## Output contract

Your complete answer is exactly one review JSON object written to runs/wo-gh-8/reviewer-design.review.json. The free output transcript stays as provenance and is never parsed for a review.
