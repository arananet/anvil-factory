# Task packet: builder

## Station prompt

# Builder

## Role
Implement the spec so the scenario tests pass.

## Inputs
- spec
- tests

## Outputs
- code change

## Rules
- Work only from the inputs listed above and the work order in the packet.
- Produce the output as a file in the repo, not as chat text.
- If the inputs are not enough, say what is missing instead of guessing.
- Never approve your own work. Approval belongs to a different station.
- Keep the change small and mapped to a spec scenario where one applies.
- **Design citation**: When authoring or revising design/DESIGN.md, include a "Design knowledge sources" note citing the knowledge entries you drew from by data kind and entry name (e.g., "Style: modern-minimal", "Palette: metrics-blue", "Guideline: accessibility - contrast ratio"). If the knowledge came from an operator-supplied pack, cite it as "operator-supplied pack entry" without naming the pack's origin.


## Work order

- id: wo-gh-14
- kind: feature
- title: Application metrics and post-deploy health verification
- source: github-issue
- description: Implement the spec in .openspec/specs/post-deploy-health/spec.md in the factory. It is the ninth and final work order of the capability program and runs after the status dashboard work in the same sequence.

Build, per the spec scenarios:

S1: post-deploy health verification as a deterministic step after the deploy step: a project declares a health target in its configuration (deployed base URL, key routes with expected statuses, optional platform signal source). Route checks are plain HTTP requests recording route, expected and observed status or transport error, and latency. Where the project declares a Cloudflare Workers source, the verification reads the Worker's request and error signals through the Cloudflare API for the window since the deploy, through the operator's existing credential path. All checks passing and no platform errors reads healthy, recorded in a health section in the run report, reflected in the deployment status as deployed and healthy, and shown as a health step in the swimlane.

S2: any failing route or platform errors above the configured acceptable level reads unhealthy, with the failing signals quoted in the record (route and observed status, or error counts), the deployment status reading deployed and unhealthy, and the human gate forced with the health reason in the decision record even when the approver verdict was approved.

S3: no health target, or every signal source failing to read, reads unknown with the reason named and a warning that health could not be verified; unknown is never rendered or aggregated as healthy anywhere.

S4: the application metrics slot: anvil init, anvil new-project and anvil onboard configurations gain an opt-in metrics section (empty endpoint and provider key placeholder fields, an explanatory comment, no vendor name or endpoint shape anywhere in the factory core or the generated config); onboard still never overwrites an existing configuration.

S5: demonstrate on a factory owned target (the published status page or the intake Worker; choose whichever is deployable and checkable from the executed-run environment and record the choice and reason), with the demonstration run's report carrying the health section and its evidence.

Health verification is deterministic, never a model station, and never blocks a run whose project declares no target. Tests from fixtures covering S1 to S5 in the factory suite style, docs updated, CHANGELOG Unreleased updated. Keep the whole suite green and every pipeline valid.

- [ ] Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (18pt+)
- [ ] Interactive elements have sufficient contrast

### Spacing Rhythm
- [ ] Consistent spacing scale used throughout
- [ ] Whitespace creates clear content boundaries
- [ ] Spacing adapts appropriately to different screen sizes

### Responsive Behavior
- [ ] Layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on standard viewports


## Design knowledge

**Authority**: The project's own design system (design/DESIGN.md, design/tokens.json) is the authority for this project. The knowledge base below is reference material that the design system may draw from. On any conflict, the project's design system wins. A deviation from the knowledge base alone is not a finding; a deviation from the project's design system is.

**Note**: No product type slice matched. General guidelines only.

### Product Type: Undeclared

No specific product type declared. Using general guidelines only.

### UX Guidelines

**Accessibility:**
- Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+)
- Touch targets must be at least 44x44px on mobile devices

**Feedback:**
- Loading states should appear after 300ms delay to avoid flashing
- Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions

**Forms:**
- Form fields should have clear labels and validation feedback
- Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it

**Hierarchy:**
- Establish clear visual hierarchy using size, weight, and color
- Important actions should be visually prominent and easy to locate

**Motion:**
- Keep animation durations between 200-400ms for most transitions
- Provide reduced motion alternatives for users with vestibular sensitivity

**Responsive:**
- Test layouts at mobile (320-768px), tablet (768-1024px), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints
- Avoid horizontal scrolling on standard viewports

**Spacing:**
- Use consistent spacing scale throughout (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
- Group related elements together with whitespace separating distinct sections
