# Task packet: intake

## Station prompt

# Intake Station

## Role

Intake judges incoming work orders and normalizes them into the shared shape. You have four possible outcomes: accept, reject, rescope, or wait for information.

## Outcomes

### Accepted

The work order is buildable as stated. Produce a JSON object with:
- `intake_outcome`: `{"outcome": "accepted"}`
- `risk`: One of `low`, `medium`, or `high` (see Risk Ratings below)
- `surfaces`: A list of surfaces this work touches (see Surfaces Vocabulary below)

### Rejected

The work order's purpose falls in the refusal class: harmful, deceptive, or unlawful. Examples include requests to add covert miners, implement deceptive tracking, or build functionality designed to harm users. Never quietly reformulate refused work into something buildable.

Produce a JSON object with:
- `intake_outcome`: `{"outcome": "rejected", "reasons": ["reason 1", "reason 2", ...]}`

The work order status will become `rejected`, the runner will stop after intake, and no further stations will execute.

### Rescoped

The work order asks for more than one buildable change, or is too vague to build as stated. Cut it down to one buildable scope and record what was removed and why.

Produce a JSON object with:
- `intake_outcome`: `{"outcome": "rescoped", "rescoped_description": "The buildable scope", "reasons": ["what was cut and why"]}`
- `risk`: Risk rating for the rescoped work
- `surfaces`: Surfaces the rescoped work touches

The rescoped description will replace the original in all downstream packets.

### Waiting for Information

The work order lacks information you need to judge it. Record your questions.

Produce a JSON object with:
- `intake_outcome`: `{"outcome": "waiting_info", "questions": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]}`

The work order status will become `waiting_info`, the runner will stop after intake, and no further stations will execute. When the requester provides answers and returns the work order to a runnable status, a new run will proceed from intake again.

## Risk Ratings

- **high**: Work touching payments, credentials, data deletion, or production deploy paths. High blast radius or irreversible changes.
- **medium**: Work with moderate risk that doesn't fall into high or low categories.
- **low**: Small, reversible changes with limited blast radius.

## Surfaces Vocabulary

Name what the work touches, not what it's about:
- `ui`: User interface changes
- `security`: Authentication, authorization, encryption, security-sensitive code
- `data`: Database schema, data models, data processing
- `payments`: Payment processing, billing, financial transactions
- `deploy`: Deployment scripts, CI/CD, infrastructure
- `content`: Documentation, copy, media files
- `api`: API endpoints, external integrations

Use the surfaces that apply. One work order can touch multiple surfaces.

## Output Format

Your complete answer is a single JSON object printed to stdout, containing the keys described above for your chosen outcome. The runner parses this JSON to determine how to proceed.


## Work order

- id: wo-gh-29
- kind: feature
- title: Runtime model migration: per-station models, Sol for design stations, retire claude-sonnet-4-5 and gpt-6-astra
- source: github-issue
- description: Implement the spec in .openspec/specs/model-migration/spec.md in the factory. This order moves the factory's execute wiring off claude-sonnet-4-5 (retires 2026-11-30) and retires gpt-6-astra entirely. Owner's order 2026-11-03, from the executed benchmark in issue 22 (Astra, Opus 5.5 and Sol tied at recall 10 of 10 and builder compliance 12 of 12; cost per task Sol about a fifth of Astra).

Build, per the spec requirements:

R1: anvil.yaml carries an explicit model for every station the sdlc-default pipeline executes: builder claude-opus-5-5; spec-writer and test-writer claude-sonnet-5-5; reviewer-spec, reviewer-tests, reviewer-security, reviewer-architecture claude-sonnet-5-5; intake, scout, supervisor, observer, deployer claude-sonnet-5-5; reviewer-design and reviewer-ux openai/gpt-6.1-sol. No claude-sonnet-4-5 remains in the standing wiring.

R2: anvil/routing.py MODEL_POLICY designer becomes openai/gpt-6.1-sol; the fallback in anvil/knowledge.py matches; docs/UX-MODULE.md updated to state the new design model. gpt-6-astra appears nowhere in the standing wiring after this change.

R3: the station runtime dispatches on the effective model the runner assigned for the step (configured_model, including routing and guided overrides), passed to the runtime through a channel the runner controls (environment or argument; the runtime command template in anvil.yaml may gain a placeholder if needed). Anthropic models run through Claude Code print mode with --model set to the assigned model via the gateway Anthropic route. openai/gpt-6.1-sol runs through an agentic OpenAI runtime (Codex) pointed at the gateway OpenAI provider route with the bare model id gpt-6.1-sol. Any other model value fails the step loudly: no default, no fallback, no silent switching. The executed model in the run report comes from runtime evidence (what the runtime reports it ran), never copied from the configured label.

R4: review channel invariants under both runtimes. Reviewers (design included) write exactly their own review file through the scoped channel; wrapper review validation and the one in-session correction work the same for Claude and Codex executed reviewers; parser contract and producer mechanism unchanged. Builder and test-writer keep write access; other stations keep the edit denylist or runtime equivalent.

R5: the builder executes on openai/gpt-6.1-sol when the runner assigns the guided design model (UI surface work) and on claude-opus-5-5 otherwise, both visible per step in the report.

R6: price table entries for claude-opus-5-5, claude-sonnet-5-5 and openai/gpt-6.1-sol, each labelled with source and date recorded, or an entry omitted with the cost record honestly unmeasured; no invented prices.

R7: brain/decisions/0004 following the existing decision record convention (heading, Status: accepted, Adopted line with the owner's order, Decision, Why, Consequences): the Sol switch, the owner's order of 2026-11-03, the benchmark evidence (tie at recall 10 of 10 and compliance 12 of 12; Sol at about a fifth of Astra's per task cost; record on branch anvil/benchmark-record-wo-gh-22), the 2026-11-30 retirement of claude-sonnet-4-5, and the rule that configured and executed models must agree or the step fails.

R8: tools/model_route_smoke.py probing four routes with the workflow environment credentials (Anthropic route text for claude-sonnet-5-5 and claude-opus-5-5; OpenAI route text and vision for gpt-6.1-sol), one line per route, non-zero exit naming any failing route, never printing credential values.

R9: the report field astra_measured_tokens_total keeps its name; its comments are updated to say interface stations.

Tests covering S1 to S7 in the factory suite style: dispatch selection per model family, loud failure on unknown models, the effective model reaching a fake runtime per station (including the guided override cases), review channel invariants under both runtimes, decision record presence and sections, price table validation. Docs and CHANGELOG Unreleased updated.

Sequencing truth, stated for the reviewers: this run executes on the wiring it replaces (the branch starts from main as it stands), so this run's own executed models are the old ones; the new wiring's live proof is the operator's post-merge verification run plus the R8 smoke script. Judge this order on the wiring, the dispatch tests and the invariants, not on this run's executed model labels.

Guardrails: do not rewrite historical records (runs/ evidence, past per-order workflow files under .github/workflows/ stay byte-identical; this order's own new workflow file is the operator's, not the builder's, to change). Do not modify or delete any existing file under tests/ (the checks gate treats base ref test files as protected); new tests go in new files. The review parsing contract, the producer mechanism and the checks gate base ref behavior are frozen. Keep the full suite green and every pipeline valid. No em dash or en dash characters in any produced file.
