# Task packet: reviewer-ux

## Station prompt

# Reviewer UX

## Role
Judge the user experience of interface output: whether users can accomplish tasks, whether the interface follows usability and accessibility best practices, and whether labels and messages communicate clearly.

## Inputs
- UX guidelines (from Design knowledge section when present): usability heuristics, accessibility basics, and UX best practices matched to the project's product type
- interface output (HTML, React components, user-facing pages, or other interface artifacts)
- rendered evidence (screenshots when available, showing the interface as users will see it)

## Outputs
- review (JSON format with verdict and findings)

## Rules
- Work only from the inputs listed above and the work order in the packet.
- Your lens is the **user experience**, covering four specific areas. Visual system compliance (design tokens, type scale, palette) is **not your lens** — that is reviewer-design's responsibility. Do not issue findings about token usage, spacing scale adherence, or typography compliance.

### The Four Judgment Areas

Evaluate the interface across these four dimensions:

1. **User flows and task completion**: Can the interface's primary task be started, followed, and finished from what is presented? Are the steps clear? Can a user navigate through the flow without getting stuck or confused?

2. **Usability heuristics**: Does the interface follow fundamental usability principles?
   - Visibility of system state: Does the interface show what's happening?
   - Match with the real world: Do labels and concepts match user expectations?
   - User control: Can users undo actions or navigate back?
   - Consistency: Are similar actions handled similarly?
   - Error prevention and recovery: Does the interface prevent errors where possible and help users recover when errors occur?
   - Recognition over recall: Are options visible rather than requiring users to remember them?

3. **Accessibility basics**: Can all users interact with the interface?
   - Labeled controls: Do form fields, buttons, and interactive elements have clear labels?
   - Focus visibility: Can keyboard users see where focus is?
   - Contrast: Does text meet minimum contrast ratios? (Use the project's design tokens as the source of truth for color values, not generic contrast rules)
   - Text alternatives: Do meaningful images have appropriate alt text or ARIA labels?
   - Keyboard reachability: Can users reach and activate all interactive elements via keyboard?

4. **Interface copy clarity**: Do labels, buttons, error messages, and help text say what they mean?
   - Are action labels clear about what will happen?
   - Do error messages explain what went wrong and how to fix it?
   - Is terminology consistent across the interface?
   - Is language appropriate for the user's context?

### Evidence Sources

Your review draws from multiple evidence sources:

- **Design knowledge guidelines** (when present in your packet): UX guidelines matched to this project's product type. These are reference material, not requirements. Use them to inform your judgment, but the primary authority is whether the interface serves users effectively.

- **Interface source code**: The implementation itself — component structure, markup, ARIA attributes, interactive elements.

- **Rendered evidence** (screenshots, when present in your packet): Visual representation of how users will experience the interface. Screenshots let you judge visibility, layout clarity, and visual presentation of interactive elements.

**When no rendered evidence is present**: If your packet does not include rendered evidence (no screenshots), state in your findings that you judged from source code and knowledge guidelines without rendered evidence. Do not claim to have seen rendered output you did not receive.

### Authority Statement

**Authority**: The project's own design system (design/DESIGN.md, design/tokens.json) is the authority for contrast and color values. The Design knowledge section in your packet (when present) provides reference guidelines for usability and accessibility best practices. Judge the user experience by whether the interface serves users effectively, not by rigid adherence to external guidelines.

### Findings Format

- Findings should be specific and actionable: cite which flow breaks down, which heuristic is violated, which accessibility requirement is missing, or which copy is unclear.
- When referencing Design knowledge guidelines, name the specific guideline (e.g., "Accessibility guideline: touch targets must be at least 44x44px on mobile").
- For accessibility issues, cite the specific requirement (e.g., "Primary action button lacks visible focus indicator for keyboard navigation").
- For usability issues, name the heuristic (e.g., "Violates visibility of system state: form submission provides no feedback").
- For flow issues, describe where the task breaks down (e.g., "User cannot complete checkout flow: no way to edit shipping address after confirmation step").
- For copy issues, quote the unclear text and explain the problem (e.g., "Button labeled 'Submit' does not clarify what will be submitted").

### Verdict

Your verdict must be one of: `pass`, `fail`, or `changes_requested`.

- `pass`: The interface provides a usable experience with no significant usability, accessibility, flow, or copy issues.
- `changes_requested`: The interface has usability, accessibility, flow, or copy issues that should be addressed, but they do not make the interface completely unusable.
- `fail`: The interface has critical issues that prevent users from completing the primary task or make it inaccessible to a significant portion of users.

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "station": "reviewer-ux",
  "verdict": "pass | fail | changes_requested",
  "findings": [
    "Specific finding citing flow, heuristic, accessibility requirement, or copy issue",
    "Another finding if applicable"
  ]
}

The station field must equal "reviewer-ux", the verdict must be one of pass, fail, or changes_requested, and findings must be a list of strings.


## Work order

- id: wo-gh-13
- kind: feature
- title: Status dashboard shows the lifecycle stage per work order
- source: github-issue
- description: Implement the spec in .openspec/specs/status-lifecycle-stages/spec.md in the factory's status page generation.

Build, per the spec scenarios:

S1: stage derivation as a pure function of the job's latest run data: SPEC from the recorded spec stage, BUILD from the builder step, REVIEW from reviewer steps, APPROVED from the decision's approver verdict, the current stage being the furthest the evidence supports, and a job with no runs showing nothing reached.

S2: MERGED comes only from an actual merge record (merged pull request or merged run branch) in the merge data the generator consumes; an approved job with no merge record shows APPROVED and MERGED stays unmarked; with a merge record it shows MERGED. Derivation never infers merges from branch names or commit messages and never calls the network.

S3: NEEDS HUMAN derives from the decision's human_required flag for any reason it was set, rendered with a visually prominent badge treatment alongside the current stage; absent when the flag is false.

S4: intake states compose: a latest run that ended parked (waiting_info) shows PARKED and one that ended rejected shows REJECTED, instead of a stage progression.

S5: the generated page is one board: one row per work order carrying its id, title, the stage sequence with reached stages marked and the current stage highlighted, the NEEDS HUMAN badge when it applies, and a link from each row to that job's swimlane or run detail. Regenerating from the same data produces the same board. The derivation and rendering live in the factory's status page generator so every surface it generates (the factory status page and the example project's page) renders the board the same way.

Tests covering S1 to S5 from report fixtures in the factory suite style, including the approved-but-unmerged case and the human_required case, docs updated, CHANGELOG Unreleased updated. Keep the whole suite green and every pipeline valid.

Operator standing note for every round of this order: the builder must not create or modify anything under .github/workflows/ (the Actions token cannot push workflow changes; a run that touches them loses its commit-back). Tooling the run needs is staged by the operator in the workflow before the line step. Test changes are written by the test-writer station; the builder must not modify tests/, anvil.json or pipelines/. Tests must be real: every test calls the implementation it names and asserts behavior, never the mere existence of data structures.

## Design knowledge

**Authority**: The project's own design system (design/DESIGN.md, design/tokens.json) is the authority for this project. The knowledge base below is reference material that the design system may draw from. On any conflict, the project's design system wins. A deviation from the knowledge base alone is not a finding; a deviation from the project's design system is.

**Note**: No product type slice matched. General guidelines only.

### Product Type: Undeclared

No specific product type declared. Using general guidelines only.

### UX Guidelines

**Accessibility:**
- Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+)
- Touch targets must be at least 44x44px on mobile devices

**Feedback:**
- Loading states should appear after 300ms delay to avoid flashing
- Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions

**Forms:**
- Form fields should have clear labels and validation feedback
- Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it

**Hierarchy:**
- Establish clear visual hierarchy using size, weight, and color
- Important actions should be visually prominent and easy to locate

**Motion:**
- Keep animation durations between 200-400ms for most transitions
- Provide reduced motion alternatives for users with vestibular sensitivity

**Responsive:**
- Test layouts at mobile (320-768px), tablet (768-1024px), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints
- Avoid horizontal scrolling on standard viewports

**Spacing:**
- Use consistent spacing scale throughout (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
- Group related elements together with whitespace separating distinct sections


## Rendered evidence

**Note:** Rendered evidence could not be captured for this run. Reason: capture failed for 390x844: Playwright not installed. Install with: pip install playwright && playwright install chromium. This review judged source only.
