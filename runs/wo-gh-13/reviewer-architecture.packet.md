# Task packet: reviewer-architecture

## Station prompt

# Reviewer Architecture

## Role
Check fit with the project structure and decisions.

## Inputs
- code change
- brain/decisions

## Outputs
- review

## Rules
- Work only from the inputs listed above and the work order in the packet.
- Produce the output as a file in the repo, not as chat text.
- If the inputs are not enough, say what is missing instead of guessing.
- Never approve your own work. Approval belongs to a different station.
- Keep the change small and mapped to a spec scenario where one applies.

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "station": "reviewer-architecture",
  "verdict": "pass | fail | changes_requested",
  "findings": [
    "Specific finding with reference to design system rule or quality bar",
    "Another finding if applicable"
  ]
}

The station field must equal "reviewer-architecture", the verdict must be one of pass, fail, or changes_requested, and findings must be a list of strings.


## Work order

- id: wo-gh-13
- kind: feature
- title: Status dashboard shows the lifecycle stage per work order
- source: github-issue
- description: Implement the spec in .openspec/specs/status-lifecycle-stages/spec.md in the factory's status page generation.

Build, per the spec scenarios:

S1: stage derivation as a pure function of the job's latest run data: SPEC from the recorded spec stage, BUILD from the builder step, REVIEW from reviewer steps, APPROVED from the decision's approver verdict, the current stage being the furthest the evidence supports, and a job with no runs showing nothing reached.

S2: MERGED comes only from an actual merge record (merged pull request or merged run branch) in the merge data the generator consumes; an approved job with no merge record shows APPROVED and MERGED stays unmarked; with a merge record it shows MERGED. Derivation never infers merges from branch names or commit messages and never calls the network.

S3: NEEDS HUMAN derives from the decision's human_required flag for any reason it was set, rendered with a visually prominent badge treatment alongside the current stage; absent when the flag is false.

S4: intake states compose: a latest run that ended parked (waiting_info) shows PARKED and one that ended rejected shows REJECTED, instead of a stage progression.

S5: the generated page is one board: one row per work order carrying its id, title, the stage sequence with reached stages marked and the current stage highlighted, the NEEDS HUMAN badge when it applies, and a link from each row to that job's swimlane or run detail. Regenerating from the same data produces the same board. The derivation and rendering live in the factory's status page generator so every surface it generates (the factory status page and the example project's page) renders the board the same way.

Tests covering S1 to S5 from report fixtures in the factory suite style, including the approved-but-unmerged case and the human_required case, docs updated, CHANGELOG Unreleased updated. Keep the whole suite green and every pipeline valid.

Operator standing note for every round of this order: the builder must not create or modify anything under .github/workflows/ (the Actions token cannot push workflow changes; a run that touches them loses its commit-back). Tooling the run needs is staged by the operator in the workflow before the line step. Test changes are written by the test-writer station; the builder must not modify tests/, anvil.json or pipelines/. Tests must be real: every test calls the implementation it names and asserts behavior, never the mere existence of data structures.

## Output contract

Your complete answer is exactly one review JSON object written to runs/wo-gh-13/reviewer-architecture.review.json. The free output transcript stays as provenance and is never parsed for a review.
